        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and then the spaghetti. Cook according to
                package instructions until al dente, usually about 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the pasta cooks, cut the pancetta into small pieces or strips and place them in a skillet over
                medium heat. Cook until the fat renders and the pancetta becomes crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs and mix in the grated Pecorino Romano cheese.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the pasta cooking water. Add the hot spaghetti directly to the
                skillet with the pancetta (heat off). Toss well to coat the pasta in the pancetta fat.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg and cheese mixture onto the pasta, tossing continuously. Add a little reserved pasta water
                if the sauce is too thick.</li>
            <li>Season generously with freshly ground black pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
