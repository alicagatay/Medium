        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook for 9 minutes, or until al dente.
            </li>
            <li>While the pasta cooks, cut the pancetta into lardons and cook in a skillet over medium heat until
                crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs and grated pecorino cheese.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.</li>
            <li>Add the hot spaghetti to the pancetta in the skillet. Mix well to coat the pasta in the fat.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from heat and add the egg and cheese mixture, tossing quickly to coat the pasta without
                cooking the egg. Use the reserved pasta water to adjust the consistency.</li>
            <li>Season generously with freshly ground black pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
